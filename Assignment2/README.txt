To run this program, I have provided a make file, so u just need to type "make" to the command line, 
and it will compile the programm for u.

After u compile my source code, you will see a executable file named ACS. You need to type "./ACS inputfile.txt"
where inputfile.txt is any of the 3 input file I provide for testing.

And for details about the code, please see the DesignDocument.txt file.
